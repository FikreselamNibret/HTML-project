      <p>
        All images will be centered and start on a new line (so text doesn't flow around them.
        They will be sized so the width fits in the content area.
        Notice how the description is displayed so the user doesn't need to load images to get the idea.
        It creates a link so the user can click to view (or they can click the pink banner that appears above at first)

  <p>Doing it this way means that anyone can open any page on txti and know that it will load super fast! Then they can choose to view images if they have the bandwidth</p>
