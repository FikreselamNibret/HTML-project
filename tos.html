      <h2>disclaimer of liability</h2>
      <p>
        <span
          >under no circumstances shall txti or its subsidiaries, affiliates,
          licensors, service providers, content providers, employees, agents,
          officers, and directors be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive,
          incidental, special, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever
          that may result from the use of or the inability to use this
          application, including without limitation, damages arising from
          mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deterioration or corruption of
          files, deletion or corruption of email, errors, loss of data, loss of
          profits, defects, viruses, and/or delays. this limitation applies
          whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence,
          strict liability or otherwise, even if txti has been advised of the
          possibility of such damages. you acknowledge and agree that the
          consideration which txti is charging hereunder does not include any
          consideration for assumption by txti of the risk of licensee's
          consequential or incidental damages which may arise in connection with
          licensee's use of the application and documentation. some
          jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability
          for consequential or incidental damages; txti’s liability in such
          jurisdictions shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
          law.</span
        >The parties acknowledge that the limitations set forth in this Section
        are integral to the amount of consideration levied in connection with
        the license of the Application and that, were TXTI to assume any further
        liability other than as set forth herein, such consideration would of
        necessity be set substantially higher. If You are dissatisfied with any
        portion of the Application, Your sole remedy is to cease using it
      </p>
      <h2>indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TXTI and its
        employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders, from and
        against all liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses (including
        without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of
        Your use of this Application, Your breach of this AGREEMENT, or Your
        infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
      </p>
      <h2>general</h2>
      <p>

        by law. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this
        agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
