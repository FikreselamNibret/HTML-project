        Txti is fast web pages for everybody. Most of the world still does not
        have internet, but many websites from countries like the United States
        are big and complicated. This makes it hard for people with slow
        internet to use these sites. It is even harder for those people to put
        their own thoughts on the internet. With txti, anyone can use any device
        to share their story

        Txti was created by
        <a href="http://barrytsmith.com/">Barry T. Smith</a> because he believes
        that high speed internet is a responsibility, not a service people buy.
        He got a lot of help from his friend
        <a href="http://neatnik.net/">Adam Newbold.</a>
